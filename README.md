# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, I decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I did a climate analysis about the area.

Included in my analysis is a jupyter notebook called hawaii_climate_notebook.ipynb in the Surf's Up folder that includes an analysis of precipitation, temperature, and relvant station data.

Additionally, I've created a Flask API that can be found in my app.py file also within the Surf's Up folder that includes some of the analysis found in my jupyter notebook.
